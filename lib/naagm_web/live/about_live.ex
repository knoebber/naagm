          Our wedding will take place at a family venue amongst the redwoods, a few miles inland from the Mendocino Coast.
          The wedding itself will take place on Saturday evening, June 21st, 2025.
          The ceremony will be at 4:30 pm, with a reception to follow. Details to come.

          The venue is outdoors, so please be prepared to spend the evening in grass or gravel and mild outdoor temperature fluctuations.
        </p>

        <p>
          We  really appreciate our family and friends gathering from far and wide and we are so excited to see you all in one place!
          To that end, we hope to spend additional time with folks visiting from out of town.
          So, share your travel plans with us and check back as the time draws nearer, since we hope to coordinate some additional informal gatherings in the days before the wedding.
          <.link href="#lodging">Camping at the venue</.link>
          is also available for more unstructured social time.
          Mendocino is truly a special place to visit, so if you have the time,
          there is plenty to do and see (restaurants, wine, epic coastline, redwoods, state parks, etc.).
          We outlined some of our favorite destinations later on this page.

        <h2>How to get there</h2>
        <p>
          Hwy 1 along the Mendocino Coast is a popular road trip destination.
          If you are traveling, we hope you will make the most of it.
          From the north, we recommend hugging the coast for a spectacularly scenic drive.
          From the south, you will likely pass Anderson Valley on Hwy 128, which is also a significant destination for wineries and wine tasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The closest airport is in Santa Rosa (2hr 15 from venue).
          Common alternative options are San Francisco, Oakland, or Sacramento (3hr 30 to 4 hr drives).
        </p>
        <p>
          Most guests will likely drive their own car to the venue.
          But if you can, we enthusiastically encourage carpooling with other guests!
          If you want to avoid driving on the windy road at night, there is plenty of room to camp on site.
          Ride share apps are not available.
          You can try the local taxi service, but cell service at our venue is limited, so it may be prudent to pre-arrange your return trip.

          This will be a fun environment for unstructured socialization throughout the weekend.
          Keep in mind that you will be in the thick of the action and there may be noise and disruptions - especially on Saturday night!
          And beware, you may be roped into a task or two if you are around during the day.
          Reservations via Hipcamp are not necessary for Thurs-Sun, but we would like to know of your intention to camp for our own planning purposes.
          Let us know directly or with your RSVP.

        <h3>Hotels, vacation rentals, and more</h3>
        <p>
          The Mendocino Coast is a popular spot, so there are some fabulous options if you BOOK AHEAD!
          Beyond hotels, we recommend expanding your search to vacation homes and bed & breakfasts.
          Expand your search to anywhere between Fort Bragg and Little River.
